Since 2007 StoRM is present on the scene of the GRID Storage Elements solutions. Itâ€™s a multi-service middleware software currently deployed to more than 50 data centers world-wide scaling from small installations to the Italian Tier 1. StoRM provides a commodity interface to manage storage space and user files hiding the specific implementation of the storage system by means of an implementation of the standard SRM 2.2 interface and fine grained authorization mechanisms. The software has been designed around the driving principle of leveraging the advantages of cluster filesystems like GPFS and Lustre and to provide simple integration facilities for tape solutions like TSM. The result is a light weight, almost stateless, storage backend agnostic system. Last development efforts have been driven in opening toward new user communities and their needs, within  EMI 3 release StoRM provides a brand new WebDAV interface. This interface hides the details of the SRM protocol and allows users to mount remote grid storage as a volume of their own desktops on almost any operating system. It represents a single entry point to the storage data (both file management and transfer) providing different authentication models (typical grid X509 proxyes, standard x509 certificates, anonymous http read access) while at the same time maintaining full grid data compliance. Taking into account the chance of federating more etherogeneous SE instances in a WebDAV federation using UGR [?] StoRM solution is ready for a second childhood.
